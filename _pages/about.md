I'm a software engineer focused on building machine learning systems and cloud infrastructure. My masters thesis was in explainable machine learning, specifically in relation extraction tasks for generative language models. I view software systems as socio-technical creations and attempt to situate people and their requirements within the technical assemblage that we build and operate.
