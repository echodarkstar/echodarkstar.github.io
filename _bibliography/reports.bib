  abstract={Persona based neural conversational models are important in the world of chatbots and to test the consistency of such models is integral for them being performant. We present an automated mechanism to detect the breaking point of such models, specifically targeting “TransferTransfo” (Wolf et al., 2019b). Natural language inference is used to calculate a metric stating the average number of utterances required to break a persona based model. An extensive comparison between and random-sequenced-inputs and personality-sentences-permuted-inputs has been performed.},

  title={DevAuth: Device Based Federated Login},

  abstract={Federated login using protocols like OpenID Connect is convenient as it solves the problem of password reuse by allowing the use of the same account across different websites, but that creates another issue. The main problem in this infrastructure is reliance on these third-party identity providers to relay information to client applications. We seek to address the problem of our reliance on corporate ownership of sensitive user information. In this paper we propose DevAuth, a device based federated login mechanism that selectively allows client applications access to user information without them going through third parties. We design a flow for DevAuth that resembles the RFC-6819 implicit flow, and assess the security implications of such a protocol. We show that although future work needs to be done to holistically assess the protocol, it is a viable alternative to current federated login techniques.},

  title={Face Verification and Forgery Detection for Ophthalmic Surgery Images},

  journal={Presented in IEEE sponsored I2CT 2019},
  year={2019},
  abstract={Although modern face verification systems are accessible and accurate, they are not always robust to pose variance and occlusions. Moreover, accurate models require a large amount of data to train. We structure our experiments to operate on small amounts of data obtained from an NGO that funds opthalmic surgeries. We set up our face verification task as that of verifying pre-operation and post-operation images of a patient that undergoes opthalmic surgery, and as such the post-operation images have occlusions like an eye patch. In this paper, we present a system that performs the face verification task using one-shot learning. To this end, our paper uses deep convolutional networks and compares different model architectures and loss functions. Our best model achieves 85% test accuracy. During inference time, we also attemt to detect image forgeries in addition to performing face verification. To achieve this, we use Error Level Analysis. Finally, we propose an inference pipeline that demonstrates how these techniques can be used to implement an automated face verification and forgery detection system.},
